[ruby1.9.3-with-tk]  Starting Mon Nov 24 06:31:08 IST 2014

======================================================================

This script for Mac OS X tries to install ruby 1.9.3 with tk 8.5:
  * The installation (including homebrew) will be entirely self-contained
    and will not affect any tools you have installed already.
  * It will modify .bash_profile if you ask it to.
  * It will install in /Users/venkat/ruby1.9.3-with-tk and create a log in ./proglang-proglang-002-software_installation-install-ruby1.9.3-with-tk.sh.log
  * Renaming or moving /Users/venkat/ruby1.9.3-with-tk might break ruby.
  * To uninstall, delete /Users/venkat/ruby1.9.3-with-tk
  * To install elsewhere, run:
      bash ./proglang-proglang-002-software_installation-install-ruby1.9.3-with-tk.sh "elsewhere"

==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /Users/venkat/ruby1.9.3-with-tk/homebrew.

Mac OS X provides similar software, and installing this software in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

OS X provides the BSD libedit library, which shadows libreadline.
In order to prevent conflicts when programs look for libreadline we are
defaulting this GNU Readline installation to keg-only.

Generally there are no consequences of this for you. If you build your
own software and it requires this formula, you'll need to add to your
build variables:

    LDFLAGS:  -L/Users/venkat/ruby1.9.3-with-tk/homebrew/opt/readline/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/Users/venkat/ruby1.9.3-with-tk/homebrew/opt/readline/include

Run 'source /Users/venkat/ruby1.9.3-with-tk/paths' to get this in the current shell.

Do you also want this version of ruby aliased as 'ruby-tk'?
(The command 'ruby-tk' would run this version of ruby.)
Type 'yes' or 'no', then RETURN [default = no]:  
Edited /Users/venkat/.bash_profile to add ruby-tk/irb-tk/gem-tk aliases in future shells.
